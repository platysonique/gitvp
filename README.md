- Go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab.
- Enter your username and a Personal Access Token ([create at GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens)).
- Click "Save Credentials to Keyring" for best security.

**3. Use the Dashboard:**

- **Pull Requests/Issues:** Select an entry, then use:
    - **Approve / Merge / Request Changes** (PRs)
    - **Reply / Edit / Close / Reopen / React** (Issues)
    - **Comment** (PRs and Issues)
    - **Refresh** for latest data
    - **Show PR Reviews** (see review history)
- **Version \& Push Tab:**
    - Edit version, commit message, manage and push tags, and perform version bumps all in one place.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **No dashboard controls/buttons?**
    - Ensure a project is loaded, the repo is initialized, and credentials are set.
    - Click "Refresh Dashboard."
- **Module import errors?**
    - Double-check that all required system packages are installed (see above).
    - For missing `tkinter`, re-run your distro‚Äôs install command.
- **Cannot use pip or get system errors?**
    - Always prefer your distro's package manager for Python modules when using system Python.


## ‚ö° Design \& Implementation Highlights

- All GitHub actions are in-app and context-aware.
- API calls are background-threaded for smooth UI.
- Credential storage defaults to system keyring using `python3-keyring`.
- **No browser or terminal window** ever required‚Äîwork entirely from your desktop GUI.
- Desktop shortcut (`.desktop` file) uses your current Python and appears in your app drawer.
- Completely open source, pure Python/Tkinter.


## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing \& Support

- Fork, improve, and share the tool!
- Found bugs or have ideas? File an issue or Pull Request on the original repository.
- This README and all onboarding commands are written for simplicity and reliability; if you need commands for a different Linux or custom Python stack, just ask.
